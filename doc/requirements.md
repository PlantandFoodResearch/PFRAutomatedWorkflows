# Requirements

This is a simple list of requirements for an automated workflow.

1. Simple config. Readability for scientists
2. Well documented
3. Integrate openlava/a n other job submission
4. Integrate complex workflow graphs (conflicts 1.)
5. Integrate Slack, Gitter, or other chosen notification channel.
6. GUI?
7. Git integration
8. Support diverse languages and tools
9. Lightweight and shareable
10. Docker integration

## Scope

- Variant analysis for whole genome and resequencing projects
	- pool sequencing
	- gVCF joint genotyping workflows
- RNAseq
- variant manipulation for generating data bundles  for scientists
- workflows for downstream analysis of variant data eg population and association genetics

## Candidates

- [Nextflow](http://www.nextflow.io/)
- [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) + WDL 
- etc
